 A lightweight vanilla JavaScript context menu library with FontAwesome support.
This library was written for use in a personal project of mine as an AIO solution for the features of a context menu that I wanted that I could only find spread across multiple different context menu libraries. This is very early doors and I will continue to maintain this however slowly that may be as I build my personal projects and use cases change or the need for features arise.
